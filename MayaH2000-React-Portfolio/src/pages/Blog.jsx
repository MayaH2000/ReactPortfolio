      Originally from California, I've made Kansas my current home, bringing new experiences and a change in surroundings that showcase my adaptability and willingness to explore different environments.

Being married reflects my commitment to my significant other, highlighting the importance of building a strong partnership that extends to various aspects of my life, including my interests and endeavors.

My passion for web development and design demonstrates my creative and tech-savvy mindset, allowing me to combine artistic flair with technical skills to create visually appealing and functional websites. I utilize problem-solving abilities and attention to detail in this domain.

In addition to my love for web development, I have a passion for traveling. Colorado, with its breathtaking landscapes and outdoor activities, has captured my heart. I'm also drawn to the allure of the ocean, finding solace in the calming waves, sandy beaches, and the vastness of the sea. These destinations provide me with a sense of adventure, relaxation, and a chance to connect with nature.

When it comes to music, I have an eclectic taste, enjoying country and alternative genres, as well as some classical music. This suggests a broad appreciation for different styles and a willingness to explore diverse forms of artistic expression.

Outside of my love for design and music, I have a practical side as an electrician. I find satisfaction in the physicality of turning wrenches and building things, fulfilling my desire for hands-on work and a tangible sense of accomplishment. This hands-on approach translates into my interest in web design as well, where I apply similar problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

Overall, I am a versatile individual who embraces creativity, exploration, and a strong work ethic. My interests and skills span various domains, allowing me to make meaningful contributions in both digital and physical realms.
